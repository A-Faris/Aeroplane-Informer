# Aeroplane Informer

This application takes data from the Airlabs API and combines it with other sources to make a useful command line app that views all departures from a specific airport.

This application is able to:

- Search for any Airport in the world
- Find all the flights leaving that airport
- Extract the location of all of the destinations of the airports
- Combine that data with the weather at each of the destinations of the flights
- Export this data to a HTML file
